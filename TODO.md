--- Autofill Project ---
Fill out forums tend to use this trend, "thing" followed by [box to input field]

1. Have user input their cv on our own forum.
2. Use that forum as the basis of our autofill, use flexible dictionary listings to train up model i.e. one website may word it one way, another might ask for the same thing but call it something else.
